This is a Statistics calculator using Java. It computes probabilistic queries from some of the most common discrete and continuous distributions: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Geometric, Uniform, Exponential, Gamma and Normal. 
The user can choose a distribution and input its parameters and a value for a random variable from this distribution. The calculator then computes a few probabilistic queries such as an exact query (only for a discrete distribution), left cumulative distribution function (cdf) and right cdf. 
There are two versions, a console version and a GUI version. The console version is based on standard input/output and the GUI version uses JavaFX. In both cases, all input is validated before evaluation takes place.
